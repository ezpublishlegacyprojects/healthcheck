This is an extension that will run some basic checks on your eZ Publish
installation and server setup, and see that it complies to the performance
standards detailed on ez.no and ezpedia.org. It adds a new tab to the
administration interface which can be used to check various aspects of the
system setup.

It is currently quite incomplete and alpha quality. Any suggestions for tests
are welcome.

Based on an idea by Kristian Hole, relayed via kracker to Michael Maclean
<michael@emcuk.com> who started coding.
